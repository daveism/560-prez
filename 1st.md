# Reproducible Research, Investigating Hurricanes with hurdat2 data and R
I like the ideas behind reproducible research.  

The following uses R and Github to import, clean, and investigate some basics with Hurricanes. While also demonstrating one take on accomplishing reproducible research.

## A little backgound

NOAA's National Hurricane Center publishes historical hurricane data in the hurdat2 format.
The complete list of available data is here;
http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html

The Official documentation for the hurdat2 format can be found at   http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/newhurdat-format.pdf.

*Note: When this data is updated, it appears that when the file name is also updated and the old file is no longer available.*

So you **MAY** have to update locations to both the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific - [get_data.R](get_data.R#L7-L8)
