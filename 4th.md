## Lets look at what that created.
The code generates a bunch of charts and maps we can use in some basic analysis lets take a look if wind speeds are trending up in Hurricanes.

First lets take a look if the data makes sense.  First lets look at wind and pressure.  They should be related.

***Wind vs pressure for all basins***

Next let's look at the same thing for the Eastern Pacific and Western Pacific.

#### look at wind vs pressure of each basin
Western Atlantic
