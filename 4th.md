## Lets look at max wind speed
I have added a bunch of extra data.  Like max wind speed and converting wind speed to MPH, because it's easier for me to relate to MPH.  This allows us to look at wind speed in several different ways.  Bar charts seem like the simplest way to look at data.  Maybe we can see a trend of intense hurricanes (higher wind speeds) trending up over time.

I also added a field in the hurdata2 data that creates a storm id that uses the year, storm order, and basin to create a numeric value.  This way we can see storms by year in a scatter plot. As an example, the fifth storm int the Atlantic in 1970 would have an id of 197005.1.

***Max wind speed for storms for all basins***

Looks like a slight upward trend in the later years.  

***Max wind speed for storms for Western Atlantic***

Looks like a slight upward trend in the later years also maybe a little greater.

***Max wind speed for storms for Eastern Pacific***

Looks like a slight upward trend in the later years also, but in this case it doesn't  look as steep as the Western Atlantic.
