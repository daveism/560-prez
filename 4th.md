## Lets look at max wind speed
I have added a bunch of extra data.  Like max wind speed and converting wind speed to MPH, because it's easier for me to relate to MPH.  This allows us to look at wind speed in several different ways.  Bar charts seem like the simplest way to look at data.  Maybe we can see a trend of intense hurricanes (higher wind speeds) trending up over time.
