# Investigating Hurrinacens with hurdat2 data and R
I like to incorprate the ideas of reproducable research.  So lets use R and Github to import, clean, and investigate some basics with Hurricanes

## update the hurdata2 data file name and location (if neccassary).
NOAA's National Hurricane Center publishes histirucal hurricane data in the hurdat2 format.  Official documentation in this format can be found at http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/newhurdat-format.pdf.

When this data is updated, it appears that when the file name is also updated and the old file is no longer available.

So you **MAY** have to update location here - INSERT GITHUB link
