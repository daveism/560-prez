## More on max wind speed in mph!
Bar charts are great, but I want to see the scatter plot and see if there is anything happening we can't see in the bar charts.

Looks max winds might be down slightly? 

Maybe there are any differences between the two basins.

***Max wind speed for storms for Western Atlantic***

In the Western Atlantic, it looks down? I am surprised.

***Max wind speed for storms for Eastern Pacific***
