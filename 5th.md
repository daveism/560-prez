## More on max wind speed in mph!
Bar charts are great, but I want to see the scatter plot and see if there is anything happening we can't see in the bar charts.  

***Max wind speed for storms for all basins***

Looks max winds might be down slightly? 

Maybe there are any differences between the two basins.

***Max wind speed for storms for Western Atlantic***

In the Western Atlantic, it appears max winds are trending down?

***Max wind speed for storms for Eastern Pacific***

<img alt="Max wind speed for storms for Eastern Pacific" src="../master/charts/Eastern_Pacific_scatter_storm_wind.png?raw=true" width="60%" height="60%" >

In the Eastern Pacific, it appears max winds are trending slightly up?

Maybe all the storms that never became intense hurricanse are masking what we are looking for are intense storms getting more intense. Next up a max winds of intense hurricanse.
