## Now for something kind of interesting
For all of you that geek out on hurricanes. Let's generate a series of maps and charts of storm tracks for the Western Atlantic since 2000.

You can run this your self using [maps_tracks.R](maps_tracks.R) ***warning*** this will take a good amount of time, so grab a drink and sit back.

```
source(paste(repo_loc,"maps_tracks.R", sep = "/"))
```

then a graph of the date and wind speed (MPH)
You can run this your self using [run_hurr_track_charts.R](run_hurr_track_charts.R) ***warning*** this will take a good amount of time, so grab a drink and sit back.

```
source(paste(repo_loc,"run_hurr_track_charts.R", sep = "/"))
```
