## Now for something kind of interesting
For all of you that geek out on hurricanes here is a series if storm tracks for the Western Atlantic.

You can run this your self using []() ***warning*** this will take a good amount of time, so grab a drink and sit back.

then a graph of the date and wind speed (MPH)
You can run this your self using []() ***warning*** this will take a good amount of time, so grab a drink and sit back.

```

examples:


***Max wind speed for intense hurricanes for all basins***

<img alt="Max wind speed for storms for all basins" src="../master/charts/all_major_scatter_strom_wind.png?raw=true" width="60%" height="60%" >

Looks max winds for intense hurricanse look like they are increasing.

How about any differences between the two basins.

***Max wind speed for intense hurricanes for Western Atlantic***

<img alt="Max wind speed for storms for Western Atlantic" src="../master/charts/Western_Atlantic_scatter_major_storm_wind_zoom.png?raw=true" width="60%" height="60%" >

In the Western Atlantic, it looks like max winds of intense hurricans are trending up.  

***Max wind speed for intense hurricanes for Eastern Pacific***

<img alt="Max wind speed for storms for Eastern Pacific" src="../master/charts/Eastern_Pacific_scatter_major_storm_wind.png?raw=true" width="60%" height="60%" >

In the Western Atlantic, it looks up too!

Is this Real? Well all the data is ready for you to dig in too, but first lets take a look at some of the cool stuff we can do with some scripting.
