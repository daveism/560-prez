## Getting Started

First you will have to clone or download this repository.

In a text editor
* Update the location of the Hurdata2 in [get_data.R](get_data.R#L7-L8)

Open R studio
*change THE REPO LOCATION to the location you downloaded or cloned the repository*

```R
source('THE REPO LOCATION\560-prez\run_hurr.R')\
```

This will load, clean, create charts, create maps, and create csv's from the hurdat2 data so we can use it in some basic analysis.
