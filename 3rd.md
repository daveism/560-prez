## Verify it all worked

I want to make sure things imported correctly so let's take a look at variables we know are related.  Pressure and Wind should be related.  Lower pressures generally should have higher winds.

To create this chart run [charts_all.R](charts_all.R) in R studio.

***Wind vs pressure for all basins***

Looks like a definite relationship.

We downloaded both the Western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins.  Let's make sure we see the same relationships for both.

To create these charts run [charts_basins_all.R](charts_basins_all.R) in R studio.

***Wind vs pressure for Western Atlantic***

<img alt="wind vs pressure for Western Atlantic" src="../master/charts/Western_Atlantic_scatter_pressure_wind.png?raw=true" width="60%" height="60%" >

Looks like a definite relationship too.

***Wind vs pressure for Eastern Pacific***

<img alt="wind vs pressure for Eastern Pacific" src="../master/charts/Eastern_Pacific_scatter_pressure_wind.png?raw=true" width="60%" height="60%" >

Looks like a definite relationship.
