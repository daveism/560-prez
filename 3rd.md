## Lets Start looking at some data


I want to make sure things imported correctly so let's take a look at variables we know are related.  Pressure and Wind should be related.  Lower pressures generally should have higher winds.

***Wind vs pressure for all basins***

Looks like a definite relationship.

We downloaded both basins the Western Atlantic and theEastern Pacific.  Let's make sure we see the same relationships for both basins.

***Wind vs pressure for Western Atlantic***

Looks like a definite relationship too.

***Wind vs pressure for Eastern Pacific***

Looks like a definite relationship.
